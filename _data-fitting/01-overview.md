[*Data Fitting*](https://github.com/Hoshiningen/Data-Fitting) is an application designed to stream-line the process of creating charts, regressing data, and chart exportation. The user has full control over their data, and they have a variety of chart customization options, ranging from the appearance of points to the background of the plot area. 

In addition, the application can fit polynomials to data sets, and goodness of fit of each is checked through a residuals chart and various fit statistics. Users can also make predictions about their data once they've created a polynomial fit to it.

Lastly, the application was designed with chart exportation in mind, and all through the process of creating charts, a chart preview is available to help the user visualize what their chart currently looks like. Once the user is happy with either of their charts, the primary or residuals, they can save them in an image format of their choosing.
