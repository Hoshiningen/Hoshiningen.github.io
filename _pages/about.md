This website is my portfolio, and also a place where I can share my passion for different topics that interest me. They might be educational pursuits, random experiences, or something interesting I've found on the internet. I believe that having a website like this will allow me to have an audience that would be more likely to understand the things I'm interested in. I hope for interesting discussions with potential readers who also share the same interests as me. The contents of the blog posts will most likely be things I'm interested in, and won't be assigned a single topic, like programming. As I learn or experience new things, and I feel like sharing them, this will be my avenue of expression.
