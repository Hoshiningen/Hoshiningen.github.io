The launcher is the starting point of the application, and it's sole purpose is to *launch* the various tools supplied by Chemistry Solver. One copy of each tool is allowed to run at any given time, and multiple tools can run simultaneously. In addition, tools are grouped by type so that they'll be easier to find once more tools are added in the future.

{: .notice--primary}
**Important!** Ultimately, the GUI for the tool launcher is a placeholder and will be updated in the future. Disabled buttons on the launcher indicate that those respective tools are not finished yet and thus can't be launched right away.
