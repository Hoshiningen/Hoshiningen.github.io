### Overview
The Periodic Table tool provides basic information, such as the element's atomic number, mass, name, and symbol, for all known elements. In addition, element categories, such as noble gases, metalloids, halogens, etc are also identified through color as indicated by the key on the table.

In the top middle section of the Periodic Table, there is a large element preview tooltip. As the user mouses over an element, that preview box will change to reflect the element under the mouse cursor, displaying it in an enlarged font.
